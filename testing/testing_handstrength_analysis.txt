## My analysis (see data below)

The idea behind my bot is that it evaluates the hand strength of its current hand (pocket cards + current community pile)
to decide what action it should do.
Meaning that the bot calculates hand strength on the fly = want it to be very fast
Hand strength is a measure of how good the cards are (=probability that they win)
However, finding the true hand strength entails going through every possible combination for the unknown cards

Let's calculate how many combinations are needed:
we can go from most restricted (least combinations) to most restricted (most combinations)
Thank you to Prof. Godin who helped me with this idea of testing against a true probability going from most to least restrictive

case 1: after the river = only opponent cards unknown
which means 7 known cards cannot be in the deck anymore
52 - 7 = 45 possible cards
Number of total combinations = 45*44 = 1980
but because order doesnt matter, half will be repeats so we get:
total combinations = 1980/2 = 990
(we see that approxamately 1000 iterations takes about 0.03 seconds)

case 2: after the turn = the river is unknown
there are 6 known cards that cannot be in the deck
52 - 6 = 46 possible cards
To find total number of combinations, there are 46 possible cards for the river
then 45 cards left that we do total combinations as above
so 45*44 /2 = 990 combinations for the opponent cards
and total = 46*990 = 45540 combinations
We see that generally this takes 1.2ish seconds

case 3: after the flop = turn and river unknown
there are 5 known cards that cant be in the deck
52 - 5 = 47
First, we can find all the possible pairs (where order doesnt matter) for turn and river:
47*46 /2 = 1081 combinations
and for each of those combinations, then try all possible combinations for opponent cards with the leftover cards
45*44 / 2 = 990 combinations
So total = 1081*990 = 1070190 combinations
This starts to be a lengthy process (about 30 seconds)

case 4: preflop = no known community cards
(this time i actally looked up the formula for a certain number of combinations since ive never done combinatorics)
the deck will be of 52 - 2 known = 50 possible cards
To begin, find all possible combinations for the community cards (5 cards) where order doesnt matter
This is "50 choose 5" = 50!/(5!(50-5)!) = 2118760 combinations
Then, again for each of those combinations we try the 990 combinations for the opponent's cards
Total number of combinations to try = 2118760*990 = 2 097 572 400 
since 1000 iterations is about 0.03 seconds, this would take about 62 927 seconds = 17 hours
(So i wont code a thing to calculate true hand strength for this case because it would take too long to run)

But we see that this is a lengthy process for the less restrictive cases
so i need to find a faster alternative since the bot is supposed to calculate hand strength on the fly


The solution I initially thought of was to do a certain amount of random sampling:
using the deck of possible cards, just fill in the unknown cards randomly and do that many times
and it should give an estimation for hand strength

To test if this idea is viable (I wanted to make sure it was accurate enough, and that the "random" wouldnt have any bias)
I can compare to true handstrength!

I picked 10 samples of 1000 iterations (10 000 total iterations) 
just because smaller samples may have larger variance, but averaging it out will cancel
(although i did test accuracy for 10 samples of 100 vs 1 sample of 1000 and they were basically the same so doesnt matter too much)
and that runs in about 0.3 seconds which is fast enough for the bot

When comparing the true hand strength and the estimated hand strength (using sampling method)
the percent error is generally very small (generally always < 5%, many times even smaller)
and it seemed to work well even if the number of iterations in sampling << number of iterations needed for true hand strength
(especially in the flop round)
which makes me think that it is a good enough measure in the preflop round too (where i didnt compare to a true handstrength)

In conclusion, i find the method of random sampling to be a good enough estimation of hand strength
(for my purposes at least, where i dont really need a perfect esetimation)
